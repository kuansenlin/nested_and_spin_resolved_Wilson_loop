# nested_and_spin_resolved_Wilson_loop

**Implemented by Kuan-Sen Lin, Benjamin J. Wieder, and Barry Bradlyn**

This package is an extension of the original [PythTB Package](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/), which was developed and is mantained by Sinisa Coh (University of California at Riverside), David Vanderbilt (Rutgers University) and [the larger PythTB team](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/about.html#history). All credit for the essential implementation of PythTB goes to the original developers. 
For documentation for the original PythTB Package, please visit the [PythTB page](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/usage.html), as the interface is identical.

This extension contains the following modules:
- **nestedWilsonLib**: perform a nested Wilson loop calculation to facilitate the study of higher-order Wannier spectral evolution for a given tight-binding model constructed from [PythTB](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) 
- **spin_resolved_analysis**: compute the spin-resolved spectra of bulk band and Wannier spectra for a given spinful tight-binding model constructed from [PythTB](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/)

These modules are written within the framework of the original [PythTB](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/). 

The analytical framework underlying our implementation of the nested Wilson loop is detailed in Refs. [1,3], and the underlying physical principles of spin-resolved topology are detailed in Ref. [3]. Our nested Wilson loop module (nestedWilsonLib) can be used to compute both the Wilson loop (Berry phase or Wannier charge center) spectrum and the nested Wilson loop spectrum for a given tight-binding model constructed from [PythTB](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/). Combining the two modules (nestedWilsonLib and spin_resolved_analysis), one can compute the spin-resolved Wilson loop and the nested spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum for a given [PythTB](https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/) tight-binding model with a spin degree of freedom, as detailed in Ref. [3].  

## Installation

Install by navigating to the working directory and run

``` 
pip install .
```

## Requirements

nested_and_spin_resolved_Wilson_loop requires the following packages:

- pythtb
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib

## Examples

We provide a set of python example codes in the "examples" directory for the following computations:

- Wilson loop spectrum of 1D Rice-Mele chain.

- spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum of 2D topological insulator and a 2D fragile topological insulator (see Refs. [2,3]).

- nested Wilson loop spectrum of a 2D quadrupole insulator, a 3D inversion-protected or C2T-protected axion insulator, and a 3D helical higher-order topological insulator (see Refs. [1,2,3]).

- nested spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum of a 3D helical higher-order topological insulator (see Ref. [3]).

The output figures and data are also included in each subdirectory of the "examples" directory.

The python example codes were run using python3 and PythTB version 1.7.2.

Note that the examples (and the 3D examples in particular) are quite computationally intensive.
