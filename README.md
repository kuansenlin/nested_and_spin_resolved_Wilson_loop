# Nested Wilson loop and spin-resolved analysis

This open-source computation tool contains two python modules to perform separately the nested Wilson loop computation and the spin-resolved analysis, within the framework of PythTB (https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/).

The physics of spin-resolved topology and the numerical scheme of nested Wilson loop calculation are detailed in Ref. [3]. 
Our nested Wilson loop module can be used to compute both the Wilson loop (Berry phase) and the nested Wilson loop spectrum for a given tight-binding model constructed from PythTB. 
Combining the two modules one can compute the spin-resolved Wilson loop and the nested spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum for a given PythTB tight-binding model with spins.

We provide a set of python example codes for the following computations:

1. Wilson loop spectrum of 1D Rice-Mele chain.

2. spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum of 2D topological insulator, and 2D fragile topological insulator.

3. nested Wilson loop spectrum of 2D quadrupole insulator, 3D inversion-protected or C2T-protected axion insulator, and 3D helical higher-order topological insulator.

4. nested spin-resolved Wilson loop spectrum of 3D helical higher-order topological insulator.

The output figures and data are also included in each directory here.

The python example codes are run using python3 and PythTB version 1.7.2.
